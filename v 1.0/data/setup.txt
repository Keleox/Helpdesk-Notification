Installation instructions:

1.	Download Python (https://www.python.org/)

2.	Open cmd and run the following commands (These are three libraries used by the program)
  a.	py -m pip install freshpy
  b.	py -m pip install playsound==1.2.2
  c.	py -m pip install tendo

3.	In the “variables.txt” file, you can put the name of the sound file you want to use (if my weeb one isn’t good enough for you) and for your API key. The API key can be found by going to the “Profile Settings” page on the helpdesk website. An alternate sound file should also be placed in the folder, so the program can find it.

4.	Once all that is done, you can double-click "Working.py" and it will run the program. If you would prefer a windowless version, change the file extension to ".pyw". Note: the only way to check that it is running when in windowless mode is to check task manager.
